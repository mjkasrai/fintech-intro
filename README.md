Introduction about me

My name is Mina and I currently work as a Performance Analyst
for a university endowment. My background includes a bachelor's in applied
statistics, so I've been very interested in portfolio risk analysis. I hope
to use what I learn in fintech boot camp to enhance my abilities in these areas.
